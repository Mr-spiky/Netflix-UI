# 🎬 Netflix UI Clone

A simple **Netflix landing page clone** built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
This project demonstrates my knowledge of clean code, responsive layouts (for desktop), and modern CSS styling.

## 🚀 Features
- Static Netflix homepage layout
- Pure **HTML + CSS** (no frameworks, no JavaScript)
- Desktop-focused design
- Clean and structured code
- Assets included for images and icons

## 📂 Project Structure
Netflix-UI/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── assets/

## 🌐 Live Demo
👉 [View on Vercel](https://netflix-ui.vercel.app) *(replace with your actual link after deploy)*

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-spiky/Netflix-UI.git
   cd Netflix-UI
   
  ---

✅ This README is **short, professional, and visitor-friendly**.  
You only need to replace the **Live Demo link** after you deploy to Vercel.  

Do you want me to also make a **preview screenshot section** (so visitors see your UI image at the top of the README)?
